    <p>
    Machine learning has been applied to many network operations problems,
    from detecting network infections to inferring the quality of application
    traffic. In most cases, however, the models developed in the research lab
    cannot be transitioned to practice: they operate in offline settings with
    limited datasets, ignoring challenging problems from model efficiency
    and retraining to obtaining ground truth at scale. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Our research agenda considers a new direction: operationalizing
    network analytics. We describe some of the
    shortcomings of existing applications of machine learning in network
    operations in the context of broadband access networks and cellular
    networks and explain how more fundamental research at the intersection
    between networking, systems, and machine learning can help develop more
    effective solutions for managing todayâ€™s networks.

    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Sonata: Query-Driven Network Telemetry</h4>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p> Sonata is a query-driven streaming network telemetry system that uses a
            declarative query interface to drive the joint collection and analysis of
            network traffic. It takes advantage of two emerging
            technologies---streaming analytics platforms and programmable
            network devices---to facilitate query-driven telemetry.
    </p>

    <p> 
    Sonata allows operators to directly express queries for a range of network
    telemetry applications using a high level declarative language. Under the
    hood, Sonata partitions each query into a portion that runs in the switch
    and another that runs on the streaming analytics platform, iteratively
    refines the queries to efficiently capture only the traffic that satisfies
    the respective queries.

<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Software-Defined Internet Exchange Point (SDX)</h4>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p> 
        Software Defined IXP (SDX) brings the merits of Software
        Defined Networking (SDN) to interdomain routing. Today's intedomain
        routing protocol, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) constrains how
        networks can deliver traffic over the Internet. Today's networks can
        only forward traffic based on the destination IP prefixes, by
        selecting among the routes offered by their immediate neighbors. SDN
        can offer direct control over packet-processing rules that match on
        multiple header fields and perform a variety of actions. IXPs are a
        compelling place to deploy these changes, given their role in
        interconnecting many networks and their growing importance in bringing
        popular content closer to end users.
        </p>

        <p>
        SDX does more than simply replace an IXP's switches with their
        OpenFlow counterparts. SDX's capabilities enable new applications,
        such as application-specific peering---where two networks peer only
        for (say) streaming video traffic. We also developed new programming
        abstractions that allow participating networks to create and run these
        applications and a runtime that both behaves correctly when
        interacting with BGP and ensures that applications do not interfere
        with each other. Finally, we also ensured that the system scales, both
        in terms of table size and computational overhead.
        Our SDX controller has been deployed at various IXPs around the world.
