    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3"> Measuring and Inferring Network Performance </h2>

    <p>
    Our research group has been developing technologies to monitor and measure
    the performance of access networks for nearly two decades. Past work
    involved developing one of the first router-based Internet "speed
    tests", the design of which ultimately formed the basis of the speed
    tests used in the Federal Communications Commission's "Measuring
    Broadband America" program.
    </p>

    <p>
    More recently, we have developed technology to automatically infer
    application performance from encrypted traffic, in a system called Net
    Microscope. This technology was the basis for a multi-year investigative
    study with <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> on the relationships between
    speed and application performance.

        Video streaming comprises more than 75 percent of today's Internet
        traffic.  Accurately measuring the quality of experience of such
        service, both in broadband and cellular networks, is paramount.  Such
        measurement helps ISPs detect performance issues, preferably before
        customers make calls about degraded service. This allows ISPs to take
        proactive actions that can improve service performance, such as
        re-routing a stream over a less congested path.
        </p>

        <p>
        Yet, inferring the quality of an application's service on a network is
        challenging. This requires both domain expertise in networking, deep
        understanding of the target application, and systems/DevOps
        capabilities.  Meanwhile, ISPs are spending a massive amount of money
        on running customer call centers without good answers to provide: not
        because the lack data but because the lack of an efficient and accurate
        video QoE monitoring solution.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Network Microscope</b> is a system that accurately infers video streaming quality metrics in
        real time, such as startup delay or video resolution, by using just a
        handful of features extracted from passive traffic measurement. Network
        Microscope passively collects a corpus of network features about the
        traffic flows of interest in the network and directs those to a
        real-time analytics framework that can perform more complex inference
        tasks. Network Microscope enables network operators to determine
        degradations in application quality as they happen, even when the
        traffic is encrypted.

            BISmark is the Broadband Internet Service Benchmark. It is a
            project initiated at Prof. Feamster's research group at Georgia
            Tech in 2010. It is now led by <a
                href="https://noise.cs.uchicago.edu/">University of
                Chicago</a>.  The project initially developed an OpenWRT-based
            platform for performing measurements of
            ISP performance, as well as traffic inside the home. BISmark can
            measure ISP performance, visualize and monitor traffic
            patterns from users and devices inside ia home network, and
            perform other network management tasks, such as managing usage
            caps.
        </p>
        <p>
            The initial BISmark deployment spanned 400 home networks in 30
            countries and resulted in nearly 20 peer-reviewed academic
            conference publications. The project also had a dashboard to allow
            users to monitor the performance of their home network over time. 
            The source code is 
            <a href="https://github.com/projectbismark/">available on Github</a>,
            and all of the performance measurements are also publicly
            available. The BISmark performance measurements are now integrated
            into current deployments ot NetMicroscope.
