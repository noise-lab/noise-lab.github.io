    <p>
    Data representation plays a critical role in the performance of novelty
    detection methods from machine
    learning (ML). Our research agenda is exploring how different
    representations of network traffic can facilitate new breakthroughs in
    statistical inference based on network traffic.
    </p>

    <p>
    We are currently exploring several avenues and have cases released
    software packages with the associated ongoing research:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://nprint.github.io/nprint/">nPrint</a> represents packets as standard bitmaps for use in a wide
            range of classification problems (device identification,
            application identification, etc.)
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/netml/">NetML</a> produces standard representations of packet captures as
            multi-dimensional timeseries data with a focus on unsupervised
            learning problems (e.g., outlier detection).
    </p>
    </ul>

        nPrint is a standard data representation for network traffic meant
        to be directly usable with machine learning algorithms, replacing
        feature engineering for a wide array of traffic analysis problems. 
        Conventional detection and classification ("fingerprinting") problems
        involving network traffic commonly rely on either rule-based expert
        systems or machine learning models that are trained with manually
        engineered features derived from network traffic. Automated approaches
        in this area are typically tailored for specific problems. This paper
        presents nPrint, a standard, packet-based representation of network
             traffic that can be used as an input to train a variety of
             machine learning models without extensive feature engineering.
             We demonstrate that nPrint offers a suitable traffic
             representation for machine learning algorithms across three
             common network traffic classification problems: device
             fingerprinting, operating system fingerprinting, and application
             identification.

        Data representation plays a critical role in the performance of
        novelty detection methods from machine learning. Network traffic
        has conventionally posed many challenges to conventional anomaly
        detection, due to the inherent diversity of network traffic. Even
        within a single network, the most fundamental characteristics can
        change; this variability is fundamental to network traffic but
        especially true in the Internet of Things (IoT), where the network
        hosts a wide array of devices, each of which behaves differently,
        exhibiting high variance in both operational modalities and network
        activity patterns. 
        </p> 
        
        <p>
        Although there are established ways to study the
        effects of data representation in supervised learning, the problem is
        particularly challenging and understudied in the unsupervised learning
        context, where there is no standard way to evaluate the effect of
        selected features and representations at training time. This work
        explores different data representations for novelty detection in the
        Internet of Things, studying the effect of different representations
        of network traffic flows on the performance of a wide range of machine
        learning algorithms for novelty detection for problems arising in IoT,
        including malware detection, the detection of rogue devices, and the
        detection of cyberphysical anomalies.
