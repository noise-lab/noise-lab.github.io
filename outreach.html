    <p>
    An important part of our research group's activity is outreach, through
    education, policy, transition to practice through open-source software
    packaages, and other activities. The <a href="https://medium.com/noise-lab">lab news</a> has a 
    section with <a href="https://medium.com/noise-lab/tagged/outreach/">
        information on the latest lab outreach activities</a>.

        The lab participates in various educational activities, with a focus
        on outreach to under-represented high-school students and
        undergraduates. Ongoing activities include:
        <ul>
            <li>Mentorship in the Center for Data and Computing Summer Lab
                program.</li>
            <li>Summer courses on machine learning and network security to
                under-represented students in the Chicago Public School
                system, through the University of Chicago Outward Bound program.</li>
            <li>Massive Open Online Courses, including Coursera courses on
                Software Defined Networking and Applications of Machine
                Learning.</li>
            <li>Continuing education courses through the University of Chicago
                Office of Professional Education in the areas of machine
                learning and cybersecurity.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        The research group also works with undergraduate researchers from the University of Chicago throughout the year.

        Much of the lab's research has implication for local, state, and
        national policy.  Professor Feamster and other members of the lab
        actively participate in various outreach activities, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Participation in the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory
                Group (BITAG), which writes technical documents for
                policymakers in Washington, D.C. The group has presented to
                influential policymakers, including commissioners at the
                Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade
                Commission (FCC).</li>
            <li>Authoring of comments, including comments to the FCC, FTC, and
                US Patent and Trademark Office on topics
                pertaining to wireless spectrum allocation, network privacy,
                open-source router software, collection of data for research
                purposes, and intellectual property concerns of creative works
                generated from machine learning models.</li>
            <li>Regular presentation at tech policy conferences in Washington D.C.,
                including FTC PrivacyCon and State of the Net.</li>
        </ul>
