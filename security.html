    <p>
    Our research group has been developing data-driven approaches to security
    and privacy, with a focus on applying machine learning to Internet-based
    attacks. The group has developed technology that was the basis for many
    breakthrough innovations in Internet security and privacy, including:
    <ul>
        <li>the first spam filtering system based on network-level features (SNARE); </li>
        <li>the first botnet detection startup based on DNS queries (Damballa) </li>
        <li>the first early warning system using DNS registration information to detect early warning (Predator)</li>
        <li>the first large-scale study of security and privacy vulnerabilities of smart home Internet of Things (IoT) devices (IoT Inspector) </li>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Our research has resulted in transition to practice, through startup
    companies, integration into existing products, collaborations with
    industry through joint intellectual property agreements, and advisories to
    regulatory and other government agencies (e.g., the Federal Trade
    Commission).
    </p>

    <p>
    Recently, we have been applying machine learning to detect outliers and
    anomalies in <b>smart home Internet of Things (IoT) traffic</b>, and applying
    machine learning to automatically learn normal (and outlier) behavior of
    IoT traffic, with applications to smart homes, smart cities, and smart
    infrastructure.</p> 
    
    <p>
    We are also performing research in the area of <b>DNS
    privacy</b>, designing protocols and systems to improve the privacy
    properties of DNS.

        The Internet Of Things (IoT) market is predicted to grow at $520B in
        valuation by 2021, more than double the $235B spent in 2017, according
        to Forbes. The increasing popularity of these "smart" IoT consumer
        devices raises many interesting research questions. We have 
        replicated a residential broadband Internet network inside an experimental
        laboratory to study security, privacy, and network performance. By
        hosting several IoT devices (powered by CableLabs), we provide a
        unique opportunity for you to experiment with new and existing
        datasets, apply data science and machine learning techniques to
        uncover new insights and valuable information, or build your new
        application or research project.
        </p>

        <p> The Internet of Things (IoT) lab at the Center for Data and
        Computing at the University of Chicago is a unique resource that
        allows us to explore the security and privacy behaviors of a wide
        variety of devices. For example, some of our recent work has explored
        the <a href="https://tv-watches-you.princeton.edu/">tracking behavior
            of Smart TVs</a>.  </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">DNS Privacy</h4>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>
            DNS reveals information that an Internet user
            may want to keep private, such as websites, 
            user identifiers, MAC addresses, and IP subnets.
            This information can be visible to a third party
            or even between a recursive resolver and an
            authoritative server. 
            Yet, even existing solutions such as
            DNS Query Name Minimization, DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), and
            DNS-over-TLS (DoT) do not completely protect
            Specifically, prevent DNS operators from learning
            information which domains specific users are interested in.
            We are developing various technologies that work in conjunction
            with encrypted DNS solutions to further protect user privacy in
            these settings.
            </p>

            <p> 
            <b>Distributed DNS (DDNS)</b> revisit the trend towards
            centralized DNS and explores re-decentralizing the DNS
            such that clients might use multiple DNS
            resolvers when resolving domain names. We
            propose and evaluate several candidate decentralized
            architectures, laying the groundwork for future research to
            explore decentralized, encrypted DNS architectures that strike a
            balance between privacy and performance.
            </p>

            <p>
            <b>Oblivious DNS (ODNS)</b> aims to protect user privacy against a
            powerful adversary that has the capabilities to: 1) eavesdrop on
            communications between clients and recursive resolvers, and
            between recursive resolvers and authoritative name servers, 2)
            request data (via subpoena/warrant) from any number of DNS
            operators, 3) maliciously access data at any DNS server.
